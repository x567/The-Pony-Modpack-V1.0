    "Dear Queen Chrysalis, During all these past years I've destroyed a lot of lives. Now I'm starting to realize how cruel and heartless I was. I hope that you will understand my actions. I may become extremely weak, but even if I need to, I will to stop to feed myself with the love that wasn't mine. I need to pay for all the crimes I did ... for all the lives I destroyed ... for the pain that I feel.",

"I can't believe that I'm doing this, but now, I can't go back. I'm leaving the hive because I can't stand what I did, but I will miss all the family ... Tell them that I will miss them ... I'm starting to realise what friendship ... too late unfortunately."
