    "A common legend among the Ponex is that they were once human. Long ago, in a time of intolerance and hatred, a group of scientists who were disgusted by humanity's tendency towards hatred and racism decided that it was time to break away from humanity to form a new society, one built upon the premises of friendship and tolerance.",

    "These scientists built themselves a machine to genetically infuse themselves with the spirit of an animal known as a pony. Having thus altered themselves, they then built vast colony ships and headed out into the stars to create a new, brighter cilivization. One where, they hoped, all would welcome."
