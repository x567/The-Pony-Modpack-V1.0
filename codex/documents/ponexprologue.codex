    "Among your species, upon reaching a certain age it is generally expected of you to spend some time in a sort of wanderjahr, where you are tasked to go out and travel among the stars, to meet new life forms, make new friends, and learn about the ways of other species until you feel it is time to return to your people and settle down.",

    "You have chosen to begin your journey here, with nothing but your trusty matter manipulator and some basic supplies. Which . . . may or may not have something to do with those space pirates you just escaped from, and your general lack of fuel. Oh well, hopefully you'll make some new friends soon who can help you."
