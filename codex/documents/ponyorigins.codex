    "Once upon a time, in the magical land of Equestria, there were two regal sisters that ruled together, and created harmony for all the land. Then alien plant-creatures came from outer space and tried to eat everypony. Thus did ponykind discover the existence of life beyond their world.",

    "Many years have passed since then, and while Equestrian science has come no closer to understanding how Celestia and Luna raise the sun or moon, it has perfected the steam-powered warp drive. Most ponies choose to forget the entire discovery-of-extraterrestrial-life thing ever happened, but the Equestrian Aeronautics and Space Administration (EASA) has a program for a select few ponies to explore the universe and see if there's anything worth making friends with out there."
